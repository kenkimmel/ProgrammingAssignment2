## The combined functions allow a user to create a cache-able
## matrix that then can be used by the second function to create
## the inverse of the cache-able matrix and save it to a cache, 
## allowing the function to save computing time by retrieving the 
## cached inverse if it is available

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
